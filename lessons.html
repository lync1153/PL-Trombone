        Below are testimonials from those who have been a part of Paul's studio:
        <br>
        <br>
        "It was evident from the first lesson that Paul is very qualified to teach trombone.  And after the first few lessons,
        it also became obvious that he is great teacher.  His desire to actually achieve the result I am seeking drives his
        attitude and persona.  It’s not about the money, or the time; it’s about me...Maybe more important than Paul’s teaching
        skills is his character.  Based on my discourse on-line and in e-mails I see Paul as a wonderful person." Tommy S.,
        former student
        ​<br>
        <br>
        "I highly recommend Paul Lynch as a trombone instructor. Paul is a dedicated educator and invested a lot of extra time
        helping me learn and explore the basics of trombone technique...Paul's flexible and individually focused approach to
        teaching was ideal for an older nontraditional student such as myself. " Paul J., former student
        ​<br>
        <br>
        "Paul is the consummate professional while being creative and enthusiastic. He is not only self-motivated, but he is a
        professional, in the beginning, in the middle, through the completion of the tasks he takes on...Paul not only worked
        hard to do his best, but he inspired his students to follow his lead." Kay G. student parent
